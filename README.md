# Campus Compass: AI-Powered Real-Time Parking and Navigation
Campus Compass is a smart campus parking solution that uses deep learning and geospatial analysis to guide users to the nearest available parking space in real time. Developed as part of Clark Universityâ€™s initiative to improve campus mobility, the system leverages a fine-tuned VGG19 model and Haversine-based routing to optimize user experience and reduce time spent searching for parking.

## Features
- Real-time detection of parking occupancy using PyTorch (VGG19)
- Input video feeds or images to detect vacant vs. occupied slots
- Distance-aware routing using Haversine formula
- Smart path suggestion from current location to closest available parking and destination building
- Poster presentation for IEEE ClarkHack MDC 2025
- Sample visual outputs with bounding boxes for classification

## Repository Structure
- `Classifier.ipynb`: Full code implementation for training, evaluation, and prediction
- `A.zip`: Dataset used to train the model (CNR Parking Dataset)
- `B.zip`: Dataset used for testing model generalizability
- `Campus_Compass_Poster.pptx`: Presentation poster summarizing the project
- `side_final_output.mp4`, `top_final_output.mp4`: Sample outputs showing real-time predictions

## Status
This project is currently under review for full deployment across Clark University's campus infrastructure.

## Future Work
- Indoor navigation support for building interiors
- Mobile app integration with live campus feeds
- Enhanced accessibility features for differently-abled students
